# lxc-postgres-exporter

A Debian LXC image containing the Prometheus [Postgres Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter).

## Configuration

Set `/opt/postgres_exporter/.env` accordingly

## Why?

I run a Home Lab on Proxmox and my preference is to manage CTs rather than a VM or CT running Docker images (with something like Portainer).
